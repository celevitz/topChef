## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 0 notes

* Note from submitter: I could not install miktext since it isn't available 
for the version of R that I have (4.4.0). Same with pdflatex. Additionally, I 
have reviewed the items under the spellcheck and am comfortable with the words
as they are listed. Most of them are the names of the datasets, and the others
are package names or content-specific words that make sense.
