## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 0 notes

* Note from submitter: I could not install miktext since it isn't available 
for the version of R that I have. Same with pdflatex. 
* I have reviewed the items under the spellcheck & am comfortable with the words
as they are listed. Most of them are the names of the datasets, and the others
are package names or content-specific words that make sense.
* I don't know why the time stamp isn't working
* It looks like 95% of code lines are covered by test cases, and I'm okay with
that coverage rate.
* I'm not sure where the UTF-8 strings are, so I couldn't replace them.
